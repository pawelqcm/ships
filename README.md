Simple game written in **nodejs** with some *jQ*, *less*, and *jade* flavor :)

The game emerged while learnig nodejs, so there's some room for fixes. There's no persistance, user's logins/passwords are simply defined in users/users.json file.
To start simply:
```javascript
npm install
```
and then
```javascript
node bin/www
```
